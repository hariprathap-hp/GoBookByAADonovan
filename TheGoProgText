Basic Data Types:
-----------------
 ->int and int32 are not same even if the compiler is a 32-bit compiler

% operator in goLang:
	->In Go, the sign of the remainder is always the same as the sign of the dividend, so -5%3 and -5%-3 are bot h -2
	
 ->What is overflow?
 	-> If the result of an arithmetic operation doesn't fit it's source/result type's size, then the result is said to be overflowing
 	-> refer : 
 	
 -> What does a len() function return in goLang?
 	-> It returns the length of the data structure as signed integer
 	-> Why signed integer and not unsigned? Because, if it returns an unsigned integer, the condition like "x > 0" will always be true and it will loop forever
